  <h3>My Thoughts on DBC Culture Thus Far</h3>
  <h4>June 14, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      I'm about a week into Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp and I am more excited than ever! Ever since I started this journey I have been equal parts excited and nervous. The DBC culture aims to push you out of your comfort zone while simultaneoulsy creating a helpful community of people that you can turn to. It is a safe environment to learn but also a challening one. It is obvoius from the fireside chat and what I have experienced so far that you will get what you put in to Dev Bootcamp. The curriculum is there but it is loose. That is to say no one is going to hold your hand along the way. It is up to you to do the extra research when presented with the opportunity and practice every command. Overall I am extremely excited but also terrified for the journey ahead!
