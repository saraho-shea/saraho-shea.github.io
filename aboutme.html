My name is Sarah O'Shea and I'm at the exciting age of 23 living in the beautiful and sunny Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I am a recent graduate of Florida State University with a BS degree in Information Technology and Communications. Almost immediately after college I ended up landing an account management position at a hot mobile app startup called Everyware. I loved that this career opportunity was technology based however, being in a client-facing role meant I wasn't able to be as hands on with the product as I would have liked. I found myself voluntarily attending product update meetings and wishing I could contribute to the product the way the developers were able to do. As my passion quickly turned towards web development I began seeking out ways I could teach myself to code through online resources such as Code Academy. Although I plan on continuing on my web development journey regardless I would love the assistance of Dev Bootcamp to help me reach my goal!
