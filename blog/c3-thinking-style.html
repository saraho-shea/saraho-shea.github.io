  <h1>My Thinking Style</h1>
  <h4>June 29, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      My thinking style is abstract sequential. Having an abstract sequential thinking style means that I respond best to learning when my opinion is being heard. I also like to analyze a situation before I tackle it. With Dev Bootcamp this translates to me having to work slower than others and really break down a code before I begin solving it. Abstract sequential learners also can be apprehensive when it comes to working with pairs. I found that when I began Dev Bootcamp I was deifnitely nervous for pairing sessions because I tend to work better alone. I tend to work on the slow side so I hate to feel that I am holding other people back by working at a slower pace. Since beginning the pairing sessions my nerves have dropped and I have found them to be more helpful than anything else. I think the success of the pairing sessions has alot to do with the culture of Dev Bootcamp that allows them to bring such a high quality of people into the program. I now look forward to pairing sessions as a way to bounce around ideas and improve my own skills.

    I have focued a lot on improving my growth mindset since starting at Dev Bootcamp. I have always been a person to have more of a fixed mindset. Since starting the program I feel that I am less hard on my self and have begun celebrating failures by exploring ways to grow from them. Having a growth mindset can be applied to pairing sessions as well. Usually, having a fixed mindset I would want to be the best one in the pair and know exactly what I am talking about going in so that I am not viewed as a failure. By practicing my growth mindset during pairing sessions I have grown to become accepting of not being the most technical of the pair.
