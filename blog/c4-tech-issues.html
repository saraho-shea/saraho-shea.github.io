      On trend with the political correctness of our world today, it is no wonder that lack of diversity in the tech world is one of its' most talked about issues. When the average person thinks of a web developer they think of a nerdy white male sitting in the corner with a hoodie, headphones on, coding away. This is a stigma the tech community has been trying to shake in recent years with the boom of the tech industry. Although the nerdy persona may be easy to rid itself of, it still remains that the tech world is a white male dominated industry.

      To take a look at why this industry is so male dominated we would have to go way back to the late 80's/early 90's where another tech boom occured. During this era was when the personal computer was becoming increasingly popular in homes along with video games, and movies portratying white male characters. What started off as a completely female dominated industry with that of the telephone operator was making a swift shift towards the other end of the gender spectrum. It seems that the tech industry has not been able to quite recover from the perception the media has given the average sowftware developer. More than 60% of jobs in the tech industry are held by males with over 50% of those jobs being held by a white male/female.

      The good news is that steps are being made to get more women and minorities into this highly lucrative industry. There's expected to be a gap of tech jobs in the next 2 years with not enough skilled workers to fill  them. Efforts are being made to hopefully fill this gap with accelerated programs such as Dev Bootcamp that are far more accessible to the average population than a four year degree. The tech initiative encourages people to realize that the educational model is changing and bootcamps are forging a path for what is expected to be a more successful and efficient way of learning. The tech initiative also extends a grant to women and minorities interested in the programs making it easier than ever to break into the industry.
