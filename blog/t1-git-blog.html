  <h2>A Beginner's Look at GitHub and Version Control</h2>

     I am coming towards the end of my first week of Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp. The experience so far has been challenging, fascinating, and eye-opening from a technical standpoint. Over the course of the week I have began to familiarize myself with the concepts of Git, Github, and version control. Please note that Git and Github are two totally different things; something I definitely did not know prior to this week! For all the newbie's out there reading this blog I am hoping it will give you a good starting point about why version control is important and how to make use of the process through Git and Github. To do this let's recap on what I have learned this past week:
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what are the benefits of version control? 
        To start off, version control is a system that allows you to keep track of changes you make to a file. This is important because it saves you in the event of a bug or other incident wrecking your code. When working with version control you will always have a working version of your code that you can go back to. The changes you make can be anything from a typo to a whole new page. Another benefit of version control is that it allows multiple people to work on the same code without overlapping each other. For example, if 10 different team members are working on a project they could use version control to ensure that they do not overwrite one another. In the case something did go wrong they could always go back to an earlier version; that is the beauty of version control! One of the most popular version control systems is Git.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git is a version control system that lives locally on your computer. You can access Git through the command line or terminal.Git allows you to save different versions of your work so that you are easily able to go back and make changes without affecting other versions. Git uses the "git status" feature to keep track of changes that are made; changes are made by adding and commiting through the terminal. However, since Git files only live locally on your computer you must push them to a remote location like Github so that others are able to view and collaborate with your code. Without Github your code would only exist locally. In the least technical of terms you could compare Git and Github to photos you have stored on your computer and uploading them to a hosting service. Prior to uploading your photos, they only live locally on your computer and therefore you are the only one able to view/edit them. Github plays the role of the hosting service you use to upload your photos. Once your pictures are uploaded others are able to view them, tag them etc.; similarly, once your code has been pushed to Github others will be able to view and collaborate with you.

    Thank you for reading my post! I hope it has given you some insight and encouragement to use version control for any future code you may write.
